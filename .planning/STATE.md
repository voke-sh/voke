# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-12)

**Core value:** `voke lint <server>` produces deterministic per-rule findings + a stable score against an explicit published ruleset — same input always yields same output
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — mtqs-specification

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (mtqs-specification) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 4

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: N/A
- Total execution time: 0h

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: N/A
- Trend: N/A

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01-mtqs-specification P01 | 6 | 3 tasks | 11 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: TypeScript confirmed as tech stack (to be locked in Phase 1)
- Roadmap: Spec-first enforced — no rule code before SPEC-01..05 complete
- Roadmap: Phase 2 is the highest-risk phase (determinism) — isolated before rules
- Roadmap: First demoable `voke lint` artifact is Phase 4 exit criterion
- [Phase 01-mtqs-specification]: id regex tightened to [SDNPA] not [A-Z] to enforce only valid v0.1 dimension letters at build time (Pitfall 5 guard)
- [Phase 01-mtqs-specification]: Integer-first arithmetic: Math.round per finding then sum integers, not float-sum then round — ensures cross-platform scoring determinism
- [Phase 01-mtqs-specification]: Hard tier caps implemented as min(rawScore, capValue) post-computation overrides, never additional deductions (Pitfall 3)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 research flag: depth-bound algorithm + oneOf-branch threshold for 2020-12 constraints needs a short spike before implementing ING-05
- Phase 2 research flag: confirm ajv Ajv2020 handles unevaluatedProperties/unevaluatedItems correctly
